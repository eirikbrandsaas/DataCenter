This state diagram illustrates the valid transitions between five project phases: Entry, Plan, Start, Complete, and Cancel.

Valid transitions (shown as solid arrows):

    Entry to Plan
    Plan to Start
    Plan to Cancel
    Start to Complete
    Start to Cancel

Conceptual entry points (shown as dashed arrows):

    Entry to Plan
    Entry to Start
    Entry to Complete

Note: Solid arrows indicate allowable transitions. The dashed arrows from Entry represent the conceptual point at which a project enters the database, rather than an observed phase.
